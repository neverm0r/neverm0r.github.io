      <description>This is a writeup that was done after the CTF since I was busy playing The Odyssey CTF with my team Emu Exploit and got 3rd place. This challenge is a kernel pwn challenge and it is not hard at all, however I decided to write something about it since the unintended solution for this one is quite interesting.

      <description>For the last few months, I have been shifting my interested from user space program to kernel space, which is harder and a lot more interesting since the exploit code is usually written in C (my favorite language to use :d). After doing some easy and old kernel pwning on pwnable.kr, I started to look at up-to-date kernel CTFs challenge. After feeling a bit comfortable with some modern techniques and was able to solve some CTFs kernel pwn, I decided to find an old bug and try to reproduce it.</description>
